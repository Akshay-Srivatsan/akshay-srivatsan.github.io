    <h1 id="course-recommendations">Course Recommendations</h1>
    <p>I’ve been asked a few times (mostly while TAing) what courses I’d
    recommend at Stanford, so here’s a handful (written in
    mid-2023):</p>
    <h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p><a href="https://cs140e.stanford.edu">CS 140E</a> is an
    introductory operating systems course. It’s a lot of hands-on
    work—on the order of twelve hours of lab time per week, plus other
    homework—but it provides a much more <em>authentic</em> taste of
    what operating systems development is like than a more traditional
    class might. It’s particularly well-suited to students interested in
    electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or hardware in
    general (unlike many other OS classes, 140E is entirely on real
    hardware with no virtual machines involved). This class is generally
    offered once a year in Winter Quarter. I TAed this class several
    times.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>For students who took 140E, I’d recommend following up with
    either <a href="https://cs240.stanford.edu">240</a> (more
    conceptual) or <a
    href="https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs240lx-23spr">240LX</a> (more
    hands-on), depending on what part of 140 was more enjoyable. For
    students who took CS 112 or CS 212, I’d recommend CS 240. CS 240 is
    mostly a paper-reading class. There’s also occasionally a CS 340LX
    for people who really love CS 240LX.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://cs144.stanford.edu">CS 144</a> is an
    introductory class in computer networking. This is a combination
    lecture/lab class. Lectures (and exams) cover theoretical material
    and underlying math/algorithms; labs (and assignments) involve
    actually implementing a network stack in C++. When I took it, the
    final lab involved combining all the previous labs and running real
    UNIX programs over our homemade TCP implementations.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 245 (when I took it) was a very useful overview of
    databases. While CS 145 focuses more on <em>using</em> databases
    (e.g., SQL), CS 245 focuses more on how databases are implemented.
    This is mostly a paper-reading class.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 242 was an interesting exploration of programming
    languages concepts. The class tends to be more theoretical (there’s
    a lot of type theory, along with lambda and pi calculus), so the
    assignments generally take a while to think through and do; I’d take
    this in a quarter without any other conceptual classes.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
    <p>All the graphics classes I took were very well-taught in my
    opinion:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>CS 148 is an introduction to graphics; it’s suitable for
    someone with no graphics experience. Most of the assignments involve
    some amount of creative expression (the class is very visual), and
    most students take advantage of the final project as an opportunity
    to create a piece of computer-generated art.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 248A is an introduction to real-time graphics
    specifically. It’s more technical work and math than CS 148, and
    could serve as an alternate introduction for students who are more
    interested in implementing their own graphics pipeline.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 348B (no longer offered, sadly) was a great overview of
    physically based rendering. Even though the class isn’t offered
    anymore, <a href="https://pbr-book.org/">the textbook is available
    online</a> and is worth reading.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 348C is a course specifically focusing on simulation
    methods. It’s very physics-based (e.g., fluid simulation is
    basically just implementing the equations for fluid dynamics; the
    trick is doing so in a way that’s both accurate and fast). This is
    mostly a paper-reading class.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="arts">Arts</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>ARTSTUDI 170 is an introduction to photography via
    black-and-white film photography on 35mm SLR cameras. The course
    uses analog cameras (Nikon FE2s or Nikon FM2s) to put emphasis on
    planning and composing photos. This is a really different experience
    than taking digital photos (e.g., on a phone). A single roll of film
    will only hold about 36 photos, so you have to be judicious with
    choosing what shots to take. There’s no automatic exposure settings
    to fall back on, so planning out the shot (taking into account the
    ambient light level) is critical. Since you have to develop the film
    yourself in the photo lab and then print it yourself in the
    darkroom, there’s often a week of latency between hitting the
    shutter and seeing what you captured for the first time. Having
    taken this class, there’s a definite separation in my mind between
    “journaling” photos (photos I’m taking just to capture what I see)
    and “artistic” photos (photos I’m deliberately planning/taking for
    artistic purposes).</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://socialdance.stanford.edu">DANCE 46, DANCE
    146, DANCE 156</a>: these are the ever-popular social dance classes
    taught by Richard Powers. If you can get in, these are amazing
    classes; Social Dance I requires absolutely no experience, and is
    approachable even for people who think they can’t dance. Contrary to
    popular belief, it’s possible to get into Social Dance I even if
    you’re initially waitlisted; just stay on the waitlist until the
    first day or two of class to see if enough spots open up. When I
    took it I didn’t even sign up until three days after course
    enrollment opened, and I still got in after the first day.</p></li>
    <li><p>DANCE 133, DANCE 147: these are more specific classes taught
    by Richard Powers about specific forms of Social Dance. They both
    take the structure of following a certain dance (waltz and swing,
    respectively) forwards in time, from its genesis to the modern-day
    families of dances descended from it. These classes are less
    “practical” in that many of the historical forms are no longer
    regularly danced at social dance events, but Richard sometimes
    throws in the more popular ones at Jammix.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="other">Other</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>LINGUIST 1 is an overview of linguistics; the material
    covered is very useful background knowledge if you’re ever curious
    about how languages function/change/exist.</p></li>
    <li><p>LINGUIST 150 is about how language and society impact each
    other, which has important ramifications on modern society. It can
    be taken without having taken LINGUIST 1.</p></li>
    <li><p>SPECLANG [any]: The special language program courses I’ve
    taken (Sanskrit and Hindi, specifically) have all been great.
    Sanskrit was more of a reading course (like a Latin course might
    be), while Hindi was a full spoken-language/culture course. Neither
    required any prior knowledge, although in my case knowing Latin did
    help with Sanskrit.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 195/CS 199: This is a placeholder for undergraduate
    research and/or independent studies; <a
    href="https://carta.stanford.edu">this was a really important part
    of my undergraduate experience</a>. Different people have different
    feelings on research; I personally liked it so much that I signed up
    to do a Ph.D.</p></li>
    <li><p>CS 349T: This was a one-off project class taught during the
    pandemic trying to develop <a
    href="https://taps.stanford.edu/stagecast">technology to allow live
    theatre to continue while everyone was stuck at home</a>. This is
    mostly here as a placeholder for “take whatever random classes seem
    interesting”; I signed up for this class on a whim, but it ended up
    being one of the most important decisions I made during undergrad
    (it was a strong factor in my choice to do a Ph.D.).</p></li>
