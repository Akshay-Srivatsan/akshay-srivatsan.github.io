        <h3>Engineering Manager: Carta V2</h3>
        <p>
        September 2019 to Present
        <br />
        Led the rewrite of a course-planning website used by Stanford 
        students to compare and choose classes based on reviews written by 
        other students.  The website also functions as a research project to 
        determine how having course information available affects students' 
        decision making about courses.  Worked on the Product Backend team and 
        the Data Intake team from September 2019 to February 2020, and took 
        over as manager/team lead in February 2020.
