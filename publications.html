            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to learn about alternating electric
                current, magnetism, and how both interact to power an AC motor. We
                built a single-phase, 2-coil, 2-pole AC motor, known as a synchronous
                motor. The motor has a maximum speed of 12,900 RPM, produces an
                average torque of 0.0204 N*m, and is approximately 34.30% efficient.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                Wi-Fi is a common technology that allows many digital devices in a
                home or office, including personal computers, smartphones, tablet
                computers, and televisions, to connect to the Internet wirelessly.
                Over one-half of the homes in the United States, and one-quarter of
                the homes in the world, have Wi-Fi. Today, Wi-Fi is used for
                everything from retrieving documents to playing games to streaming
                movies. As Internet penetration grows and more connected devices are
                used inside the home, Wi-Fi will become even more pervasive.

                A Dual Sensor System for Determining the Unique Oxygen Production
                Signature of Plants
            </h3>

                Journal of Selected Areas in Mechatronics (JSAM), 2015 Edition, Vol.
                5, No. 1</a>
            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                Low cost sensor technology has made real-time monitoring of oxygen
                production and consumption from plants practical and affordable in
                homes. We describe an automated sensor based monitoring system
                comprising an oxygen sensor, a light sensor, and an automated data
                logging program that together enable near real-time measurement of
                oxygen production from common house plants. The results from the using
                system on common houseplants show that each plant has a very unique
                pattern of oxygen production during the course of a day. Even though
                light is critical for photosynthesis, all plants that were tested
                maximize their oxygen production during early morning hours, much
                before sunlight reaches its maximum intensity. Further, some plants
                tested here are net consumers of oxygen during a 24 hour cycle, as
                they consume more in respiration than they produce in photosynthesis.
                There are several practical applications from results observed with
                this monitoring system and interesting areas for future research.
                These include creating oxygen neutral smart homes, design of enclosed
                spaces for space travel, and deeper scientific understanding of the
                role that specific plants play in oxygen production, which has
                applications for wellness and prevention of diseases.

            <a href="assets/pdf/straw.pdf">Patent: US 9186007 B2</a>
            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                The design of a beverage sharing/tasting straw with one dipping end
                and plurality of independent suction ends, each differentiable from
                the other through a combination of one or more of color, size, unique
                sleeve, logo, material, design and the like to enable multiple people
                to share/taste the same beverage without risk of transmitting virus,
                bacteria or other germs, either for one-time consumption or during
                re-use. The length of the straw dimensions of the suction ends and
                distance between suction ends can be customized for a specific number
                of people, ages and seating configurations (e.g. sharing for 2 kids
                seated next to each other). In one particular embodiment of this
                design, the beverage sharing/tasting straw end attachment can be
                adapted to fit over any currently available standard straw thereby
                converting a traditional single person straw to a multi-person
                sharing/tasting straw.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                An apparatus and method for performing repair on the floor or side
                wall of a swimming pool or of a large body of liquid by creating a
                workable space without fully draining the water or liquid. The
                apparatus utilizes a sturdy solid tube to create a separation between
                the area enclosed within the tube and body of liquid outside. A
                guiding lid with multiple openings allows a specific tool to be guided
                into the tube for conducting repairs. A draining assembly drains the
                liquid enclosed within the tube. A drier assembly creates a dry
                workable space within the tube. A repair assembly is used to conduct a
                specific repair operation including spray painting, filling up holes,
                filling in caulking to cover up cracks, sanding within the workable
                space. An inspection assembly is used to remotely inspect the surface
                that needs repair.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                A system, methodology, and product to sort, organize and store
                individual members of building/construction toy sets utilizing a
                multi-level system of bins with sieves at different heights using user
                applied forces and gravity to automatically sort and organize pieces
                into bins, while providing a fun hands-on sorting experience for kids.
                The location, size and shape of the sieves can be designed to optimize
                sorting speed and user experience for specific toy manufacturer brands
                including Lego™ bricks made by Lego Corporation. The system also
                functions as a storage unit for the pieces, during and after sort. A
                flexible binding mechanism holds the system together during sort. The
                system is designed with see-through materials to monitor the status of
                the sort and find specific pieces in respective bins. A set of wheels
                enables mobility. The “hands-on” involvement in sorting also makes
                this an entertaining and educational apparatus for kids.
