      <h3>Modular Music Player</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
      I made this for the course EE47 (Press Play: Interactive Device Design) 
      at Stanford University during the summer quarter of 2015. This music 
      player differs from normal music players because it consists of multiple 
      independent modules. The "main" module contains the MP3 decoding and 
      processor, and it sends audio and video signals over ports on either side 
      of itself. The speaker and display modules have similar ports on either 
      sides of themselves, and will either use the signals they receive or pass 
      them to the port on the opposite side. This means the modules can be 
      connected in any order.
      </p>

      <h4>Design</h4>
      <p>
      I designed this player for people whose needs are constantly changing.  
      Such a person may need his/her MP3 player to be quiet while at work or at 
      a library, but loud while at home. He/she may want a display while 
      playing music at home, but not want to risk damaging it while biking or 
      running. Current MP3 players are "all-or-nothing" â€“ an iPod Classic can't 
      be used while biking because it needs headphones and has a fragile 
      display. A boombox can't be used at work because it is too loud. An MP3 
      player with tactile buttons may be great for use in a pocket, but would 
      be horrible for use in a kitchen (water/guacamole/whatever would get 
      stuck in the buttons or enter the electronics). Conversely, capacitive 
      buttons are great for the kitchen, but horrible for in-pocket use (how 
      would you tell the buttons apart?). It's impractical to buy a separate 
      MP3 player for each of these uses, so a MP3 player which makes each part 
      easily removable and reattach-able would be much more efficient.

      <h3>GPU Library</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
      I made this for the course CS 107E (Computer Systems from the Ground Up) 
      at Stanford University during the winter quarter of 2018. This project 
      contains a graphics library that communicates directly with the VideoCore 
      IV 3D Graphics Processor which is on the BCM2835 SoC on a Raspberry Pi.  
      It also includes demos of a GUI library and two games.  This library can 
      draw more than 60 non-trivial 1920x1080 frames per second.
      </p>

      <h3>Robotic Orchestra</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
      This project was made jointly by Nitya Tarakad and me, based on a 
      previous project by Chris Strong and Saul Woolf, as part of our Applied 
      Science Research class at Menlo School. We made robots which could play 
      multiple instruments (a piano, recorder, and a drum set) and developed 
      software to keep them in sync.
