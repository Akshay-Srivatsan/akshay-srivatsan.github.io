## About Me

![An image of me][portrait]

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University,
advised by Professors [Keith Winstein][keithw] and [Dawson Engler][engler]. I'm
currently working on [functional operating systems][fix] in the Systems and
Networking Research Lab. Outside of school, I'm interested in analog and digital
photography, playing the piano, and learning languages.

In addition to my PhD advisors, I've also had the privilege to work with:

-   Professor [Sara Achour][sachour] on mixed-signal circuit verification
    (rotation project)
-   Professor [John Mitchell][jcm] on [Carta][carta]
    ([CartaLab][cartalab]/Pathways Lab)
-   Professor [Pat Hanrahan][hanrahan], my undergraduate advisor

## Teaching

I recently co-taught [CS 45: Software Tools Every Programmer Should Know][cs45]
with [Ayelet Drazen][adrazen] and [Jonathan Kula][jdkula]. We also developed and
taught the [premiere offering in Winter 2023][cs45-23win]. We designed this
course to cover all the basic tools and concepts programmers (both software
engineers and CS students) are required to know, but which never get taught in
CS classes; it's inspired by [MIT's Missing Semester course][missing-semester],
but strives to go more in-depth and cover the conceptual background underlying
the tools.

I've been involved in teaching [CS 140E: Operating Systems Design and
Implementation][cs140e] for several years. I TAed the course in [Spring
2021][cs140e-21spr], [Winter 2022][cs140e-22win], and [Winter
2023][cs140e-23win]. I also TAed the next course in the sequence, [CS
240LX][cs240lx-22spr], in Spring 2022. CS 140E is a hands-on approach to
operating system development, starting from baremetal assembly code running on a
Raspberry Pi and working up to a small UNIX-style operating system, with a
strong focus on correctness testing and verification. CS 240LX extends the base
OS built in CS 140E to include many additional checking/verification tools like
a race detector and various memory checkers.

## Education

I did my M.S. and B.S. at Stanford, in 2022 and 2021 respectively. My
undergraduate specialization was computer graphics, and my masters
specialization was computer systems. Before that, I went to high school at Menlo
School.
