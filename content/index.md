## About

![A portrait of me with the San Francisco skyline in the 
background.][portrait]

I'm a recent graduate of the Stanford University Department of Computer Science.
I just finished my masters focusing on computer systems, and I previously did my
undergrad focusing on computer graphics. My experience ranges from raytracers to
websites, but I mostly like working at the OS level and working with hardware.
I've worked at Stanford, Facebook/Instagram, and Aqua Satellite.

Outside of school/work, I'm also interested in analog and digital photography,
playing the piano, and learning languages.

## Education

I recently finished a masters degree at Stanford University, focusing on
computer systems within the Department of Computer Science. I also did my
undergrad at Stanford (2017--2021), focusing on computer graphics. Before that,
I went to Menlo School for high school.

## Projects

[[சொற்கள்]{lang=ta}][chorkal]: a Tamil word game, à la Wordle.

[Carta][carta]: a course-planning website for Stanford students.

[Stagecast][stagecast]: software to allow musicians and actors to rehearse and
perform shows online during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Experience

### Course Assistant: Stanford CS 240LX (Spring 2022)

I'm a course assistant for _CS 240LX: Advanced Systems Laboratory, Accelerated_.
This course is a continuation of _CS 140E_, and the course is being offered for
the second time (the first was Spring 2020, when I took it).

For more info, go to the [GitHub][cs240lx-22spr] repo.

### Course Assistant: Stanford CS 140E (Winter 2022)

I was a course assistant for _CS 140E: Operating Systems Design and
Implementation_. I helped students debug during biweekly lab sessions, ran
office hours, redesigned the filesystems lab, and helped with final projects.

For more info, go to the [GitHub][cs140e-22win] repo.

### Robotics Intern: Aqua Satellite (Summer 2021)

At Aqua Satellite, I set up the development infrastructure and wrote the initial
control and simulation software for Thaumas, an automated underwater vehicle.

### Course Assistant: Stanford CS 140E (Spring 2021)

I was the sole course assistant for _CS 140E: Operating Systems Design and
Implementation_. As part of my responsibilities, I reviewed lesson plans,
refined assignment specifications, held office hours, assisted students in
biweekly lab sessions, and evaluated student work.

For more info, go to the [GitHub][cs140e-21spr] repo.

### Production Engineering Intern: Instagram (Summer 2020)

At Instagram, I interned on the Instagram Machine Learning Team (IGML) and
developed software used by teams across Instagram and Facebook.

### Production Engineering Intern: Facebook (Summer 2019)

At Facebook, I interned on the Feed and Stories Team (FAST) and developed
software used by the production engineering and software engineering teams.
