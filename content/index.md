## About Me

![An image of me][portrait]

I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University,
advised by Professors [Keith Winstein][keithw] and [Dawson Engler][engler]. I'm
currently working on [functional operating systems][arca] for [serverless
computing][fix] in the Systems and Networking Research Lab.

In addition to my PhD advisors, I've also had the privilege to be advised by:

-   Professor [Sara Achour][sachour] on mixed-signal circuit verification
-   Professor [John Mitchell][jcm] on [Carta][carta]
-   Professor [Pat Hanrahan][hanrahan], my undergraduate advisor

Outside of work, I also enjoy photography, playing the piano, and social
dancing. I help organize [Stanford Dancebreak][dancebreak], I regularly attend
[Stanford Swing Dancers][ssd], and I'm a member of the [2025 Stanford Viennese
Ball Opening Commitee][opening].

## Teaching

I am currently TAing [CS 240: _Advanced Topics in Operating Systems_][cs240], a
graduate-level paper discussion class about operating systems. I previously TAed
[CS 240LX: _Advanced Systems Laboratory, Accelerated_][cs240lx-22spr], a
laboratory-based graduate operating systems class. I also TAed [CS 140E:
_Operating Systems Design and Implementation_][cs140e-23win]
[several][cs140e-22win] [times][cs140e-21spr]; CS 140E is a laboratory-based
undergraduate introduction to operating systems.

I co-taught [CS 45: _Software Tools Every Programmer Should Know_][cs45] with
[Ayelet Drazen][adrazen] and [Jonathan Kula][jdkula] in both Winter and
Spring 2023. We designed this course to cover all the basic tools and concepts
programmers (both software engineers and CS students) are required to know, but
which never get taught in CS classes; it's inspired by [MIT's Missing Semester
course][missing-semester], but strives to go more in-depth and cover the
conceptual background underlying the tools. Our two-quarter pilot run was
successful enough that the course was later taught as CS 104: _Introduction to
Essential Software Systems and Tools_.

## Education

I did my M.S. and B.S. at Stanford, in 2022 and 2021 respectively. My
undergraduate specialization was computer graphics, and my masters
specialization was computer systems. Before that, I went to high school at Menlo
School.
