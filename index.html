    <h2>About Me</h2>

    I'm a junior at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science. My 
    favorite programming projects are the ones which solve problems whether 
    they're problems faced by a few students in a class or problem faced by 
    millions of people around the world.

    Nowadays, I spend most of my time doing backend development and computer 
    graphics. I would describe myself as a full-stack developer where my 
    definition of "stack" goes all the way from the kernel up to
    the front-end. I love systems-level programming to the point I have 
    opinions on which assembly languages are better than others. When I'm 
    working at a higher level, I enjoy functional programming and massively 
    parallel computing.

    I recently finished working at Facebook as a Production Engineering intern 
    on the Feed and Stories Team. I am currently working on the Product Backend 
    team of the Carta v2 project at Stanford.

      Every so often, I'm proud enough of a project to publish it, either as a 
      patent or a research paper. See <a href="publications.html">my
