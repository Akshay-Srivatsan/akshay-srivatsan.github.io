    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
    <p><img src="assets/img/portrait-small.jpg"
    alt="An image of me" /></p>
    <p>I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford
    University, advised by Professors <a
    href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw/">Keith Winstein</a> and <a
    href="https://web.stanford.edu/~engler/">Dawson Engler</a>. I’m
    currently working on <a
    href="https://github.com/fix-project/fix">functional operating
    systems</a> in the Systems and Networking Research Lab. Outside of
    school, I’m interested in analog and digital photography, playing
    the piano, and learning languages.</p>
    <p>In addition to my PhD advisors, I’ve also had the privilege to be
    advised by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Professor <a href="https://www.sara-achour.me/">Sara Achour</a>
    on mixed-signal circuit verification</li>
    <li>Professor <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/">John
    Mitchell</a> on <a href="https://carta.stanford.edu">Carta</a></li>
    <li>Professor <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat
    Hanrahan</a>, my undergraduate advisor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
    <p>I co-taught <a href="https://cs45.stanford.edu">CS 45:
    <em>Software Tools Every Programmer Should Know</em></a> with <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayelet-drazen">Ayelet Drazen</a>
    and <a href="https://www.jdkula.dev">Jonathan Kula</a> in both
    Winter and Spring 2023. We designed this course to cover all the
    basic tools and concepts programmers (both software engineers and CS
    students) are required to know, but which never get taught in CS
    classes; it’s inspired by <a
    href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">MIT’s Missing Semester
    course</a>, but strives to go more in-depth and cover the conceptual
    background underlying the tools. Our two-quarter pilot run was
    successful enough that the course will be taught in the future as CS
    104: <em>Introduction to Essential Software Systems and
    Tools</em>.</p>
    <p>I’ve been involved in teaching <a
    href="https://cs140e.stanford.edu">CS 140E: <em>Operating Systems
    Design and Implementation</em></a> for several years. I TAed the
    course in <a href="https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-21spr">Spring
    2021</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-22win">Winter
    2022</a>, and <a
    href="https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-23win">Winter 2023</a>. I
    also TAed the next course in the sequence, <a
    href="https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs240lx-22spr">CS 240LX</a>, in
    Spring 2022. CS 140E is a hands-on approach to operating system
    development, starting from baremetal assembly code running on a
    Raspberry Pi and working up to a small UNIX-style operating system,
    with a strong focus on correctness testing and verification. CS
    240LX extends the base OS built in CS 140E to include many
    additional checking/verification tools like a race detector and
    various memory checkers.</p>
    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
    <p>I did my M.S. and B.S. at Stanford, in 2022 and 2021
    respectively. My undergraduate specialization was computer graphics,
    and my masters specialization was computer systems. Before that, I
    went to high school at Menlo School.</p>
