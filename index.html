      I'm a senior at Stanford University majoring in (and pursuing a masters'
      in) Computer Science.  I love integrating systems in clever ways,
      especially when those systems were designed for completely different
      purposes at different times&mdash;recently I've been trying to convince
      Linux to use a typewriter for I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
      Nowadays, I spend most of my time doing systems development and computer 
      graphics.  I would describe myself as a full-stack developer where my 
      definition of "stack" goes all the way from the kernel up to
      the front-end.  I love systems-level programming to the point I have 
      opinions on which assembly languages are better than others.  At a higher
      level, I enjoy learning about new programming paradigms and languages.
      </p>

      I recently finished working at Instagram as a Production Engineering intern
      on the Instagram Machine Learning team. I am currently a Course Assistant

        <h3>Modular Music Player</h3>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
        I made this for the course EE47 (Press Play: Interactive Device Design)
        at Stanford University during the summer quarter of 2015. This music
        player differs from normal music players because it consists of
        multiple independent modules. The "main" module contains the MP3
        decoding and processor, and it sends audio and video signals over I/O
        ports on either side of itself. The speaker and display modules have
        similar ports on either sides of themselves, and will either use the
        signals they receive or pass them to the port on the opposite side.
        This means the modules can be connected in any order.

        The goal of this project was to learn about alternating electric 
        current, magnetism, and how both interact to power an AC motor.  We 
        built a single-phase, 2-coil, 2-pole AC motor, known as a synchronous 
        motor. The motor has a maximum speed of 12,900 RPM, produces an average 
        torque of 0.0204 N*m, and is approximately 34.30% efficient.

        <p>
        Wi-Fi is a common technology that allows many digital devices in a home 
        or office, including personal computers, smartphones, tablet computers, 
        and televisions, to connect to the Internet wirelessly. Over one-half 
        of the homes in the United States, and one-quarter of the homes in the 
        world, have Wi-Fi. Today, Wi-Fi is used for everything from retrieving 
        documents to playing games to streaming movies. As Internet penetration 
        grows and more connected devices are used inside the home, Wi-Fi will 
        become even more pervasive.

          5, No.  1</a>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
        Low cost sensor technology has made real-time monitoring of oxygen 
        production and consumption from plants practical and affordable in 
        homes. We describe an automated sensor based monitoring system 
        comprising an oxygen sensor, a light sensor, and an automated data 
        logging program that together enable near real-time measurement of 
        oxygen production from common house plants. The results from the using 
        system on common houseplants show that each plant has a very unique 
        pattern of oxygen production during the course of a day. Even though 
        light is critical for photosynthesis, all plants that were tested 
        maximize their oxygen production during early morning hours, much 
        before sunlight reaches its maximum intensity. Further, some plants 
        tested here are net consumers of oxygen during a 24 hour cycle, as they 
        consume more in respiration than they produce in photosynthesis. There 
        are several practical applications from results observed with this 
        monitoring system and interesting areas for future research. These 
        include creating oxygen neutral smart homes, design of enclosed spaces 
        for space travel, and deeper scientific understanding of the role that 
        specific plants play in oxygen production, which has applications for 
        wellness and prevention of diseases.

        <a href="assets/pdf/straw.pdf">Patent: US 9186007 B2</a>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
        The design of a beverage sharing/tasting straw with one dipping end and 
        plurality of independent suction ends, each differentiable from the 
        other through a combination of one or more of color, size, unique 
        sleeve, logo, material, design and the like to enable multiple people 
        to share/taste the same beverage without risk of transmitting virus, 
        bacteria or other germs, either for one-time consumption or during 
        re-use. The length of the straw dimensions of the suction ends and 
        distance between suction ends can be customized for a specific number 
        of people, ages and seating configurations (e.g. sharing for 2 kids 
        seated next to each other). In one particular embodiment of this 
        design, the beverage sharing/tasting straw end attachment can be 
        adapted to fit over any currently available standard straw thereby 
        converting a traditional single person straw to a multi-person 
        sharing/tasting straw.

        An apparatus and method for performing repair on the floor or side wall 
        of a swimming pool or of a large body of liquid by creating a workable 
        space without fully draining the water or liquid. The apparatus 
        utilizes a sturdy solid tube to create a separation between the area 
        enclosed within the tube and body of liquid outside. A guiding lid with 
        multiple openings allows a specific tool to be guided into the tube for 
        conducting repairs. A draining assembly drains the liquid enclosed 
        within the tube. A drier assembly creates a dry workable space within 
        the tube. A repair assembly is used to conduct a specific repair 
        operation including spray painting, filling up holes, filling in 
        caulking to cover up cracks, sanding within the workable space. An 
        inspection assembly is used to remotely inspect the surface that needs 
        repair.

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
        A system, methodology, and product to sort, organize and store 
        individual members of building/construction toy sets utilizing a 
        multi-level system of bins with sieves at different heights using user 
        applied forces and gravity to automatically sort and organize pieces 
        into bins, while providing a fun hands-on sorting experience for kids.  
        The location, size and shape of the sieves can be designed to optimize 
        sorting speed and user experience for specific toy manufacturer brands 
        including Lego™ bricks made by Lego Corporation. The system also 
        functions as a storage unit for the pieces, during and after sort.  A 
        flexible binding mechanism holds the system together during sort.  The 
        system is designed with see-through materials to monitor the status of 
        the sort and find specific pieces in respective bins. A set of wheels 
        enables mobility. The “hands-on” involvement in sorting also makes this 
        an entertaining and educational apparatus for kids.
