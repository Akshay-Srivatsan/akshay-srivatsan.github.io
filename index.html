                            I'm a freshman at Stanford University planning on majoring in Computer Science.
                            My favorite programming projects are the ones which solve problems, whether they're problems faced by a few students in a class or problems faced by millions of people around the world.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I spend most of my time doing front-end web development, but I also have experience doing back-end development.
                            I also love systems-level programming&mdash;Assembly and Python regularly switch places as my favorite programming language.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I'm currently working on a hackathon called <a href="https://totalityhacks.com">TotalityHacks</a>. I'm also developing a curriculum for teaching new CS students how to debug effectively.

                                    late summer; the registration website allows

                                    their information, and answer our application

                                    travel reimbursements to.

                                    I improved the "Wand" (a gesture-based controller) and the paint
                                    program on Looma, a low-cost educational computer that can function
                                    without power or internet. I also created a new dual-language
                                    on-screen keyboard and web browser for Looma and integrated an
                                    open-source speech synthesizer.
                                    <h6>Mentor</h6>
                                    I helped teach new interns at VillageTech Solutions how to code in
                                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also advised them on how to design their
                                    code to efficiently integrate with the other parts of Looma.

                                        In May 2014, I created a new website for the Menlo School
                                        chapter of the Junior Classical League. I continued to
                                        maintain it that year and the following year, winning
                                        4th and 3rd places in the National JCL Website Contest.
                                        In the 2016-17 academic year, I taught a new webmaster
                                        how to run the website so he could continue to maintain
                                        it after my graduation.

                                        Classical League for the 2016-2017 term. I acted as
                                        the administrator for CJCL's Google Apps accounts,
                                        and I started work on a redesign of the website.

                        <h4>Modular Music Player</h4>
                        <h5>Summary</h5>
                        I made this for the course EE47 (Press Play: Interactive Device Design)
                        at Stanford University during the summer quarter of 2015. This music
                        player differs from normal music players because it consists of
                        multiple independent modules. The "main" module contains the MP3
                        decoding and processor, and it sends audio and video signals over
                        ports on either side of itself. The speaker and display modules
                        have similar ports on either sides of themselves, and will either
                        use the signals they receive or pass them to the port on the
                        opposite side. This means the modules can be connected in any
                        order.
                        <h5>Demo</h5>
                        <div class="video-container">
                                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ACNUcU-_VM0?rel=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Design</h5>
                        I designed this player for people whose needs are constantly changing.
                        Such a person may need his/her MP3 player to be quiet while at work or at a library,
                        but loud while at home. He/she may want a display while playing music at home,
                        but not want to risk damaging it while biking or running.
                        Current MP3 players are "all-or-nothing" – an iPod Classic can't be used
                        while biking because it needs headphones and has a fragile display.
                        A boombox can't be used at work because it is too loud.
                        An MP3 player with tactile buttons may be great for use in a pocket,
                        but would be horrible for use in a kitchen (water/guacamole/whatever
                        would get stuck in the buttons or enter the electronics). Conversely,
                        capacitive buttons are great for the kitchen, but horrible for in-pocket
                        use (how would you tell the buttons apart?). It's impractical to buy a separate
                        MP3 player for each of these uses, so a MP3 player which makes each part easily
                        removable and reattach-able would be much more efficient.

                        <h5>Summary</h5>
                        I made this for the course CS 107E (Computer Systems from the Ground Up)
                        at Stanford University during the winter quarter of 2018. This project contains
                        a graphics library that communicates directly with the VideoCore IV 3D Graphics
                        Processor which is on the BCM2835 SoC on a Raspberry Pi. It also includes demos
                        of a GUI library and two games. This library can draw more than 60 non-trivial
                        1920x1080 frames per second.

                        I co-produced the Menlo Class of 2017 Senior Appreciation Show with Jason
                        Scharff and Nitya Tarakad. The show is an annual tradition by Menlo seniors
                        to honor those who have helped them in high school. In 2017, the theme
                        the senior class picked was the Tony Awards. Our show was a parody of the
                        Tony Awards, with the lyrics of songs from Broadway musicals adjusted
                        to be relevant to the Menlo community. It featured all 133 members of the
                        Class of 2017, including a performance from a band consisting of members
                        of the class.

                        I was also the technical director for this show. I oversaw the crew for
                        the show, and I was responsible for managing the equipment rental from
                        Musson.

                            The goal of this project was to learn about alternating electric current,
                            magnetism, and how both interact to power an AC motor. We built a
                            single-phase, 2-coil, 2-pole AC motor, known as a synchronous motor.
                            The motor has a maximum speed of 12,900 RPM, produces an average
                            torque of 0.0204 N*m, and is approximately 34.30% efficient.

                            Wi-Fi is a common technology that allows many digital devices in a home or office, including personal computers, smartphones, tablet computers, and televisions, to connect to the Internet wirelessly. Over one-half of the homes in the United States, and one-quarter of the homes in the world, have Wi-Fi. Today, Wi-Fi is used for everything from retrieving documents to playing games to streaming movies. As Internet penetration grows and more connected devices are used inside the home, Wi-Fi will become even more pervasive.

                            <h5>Abstract</h5>
                            Low cost sensor technology has made real-time
                            monitoring of oxygen production and consumption from plants
                            practical and affordable in homes. We describe an automated
                            sensor based monitoring system comprising an oxygen sensor, a
                            light sensor, and an automated data logging program that
                            together enable near real-time measurement of oxygen production
                            from common house plants. The results from the using system on
                            common houseplants show that each plant has a very unique
                            pattern of oxygen production during the course of a day. Even
                            though light is critical for photosynthesis, all plants that were
                            tested maximize their oxygen production during early morning
                            hours, much before sunlight reaches its maximum intensity.
                            Further, some plants tested here are net consumers of oxygen
                            during a 24 hour cycle, as they consume more in respiration than
                            they produce in photosynthesis. There are several practical
                            applications from results observed with this monitoring system
                            and interesting areas for future research. These include creating
                            oxygen neutral smart homes, design of enclosed spaces for space
                            travel, and deeper scientific understanding of the role that
                            specific plants play in oxygen production, which has applications
                            for wellness and prevention of diseases.

                            The design of a beverage sharing/tasting straw with one dipping end and plurality of independent suction ends, each differentiable from the other through a combination of one or more of color, size, unique sleeve, logo, material, design and the like to enable multiple people to share/taste the same beverage without risk of transmitting virus, bacteria or other germs, either for one-time consumption or during re-use. The length of the straw dimensions of the suction ends and distance between suction ends can be customized for a specific number of people, ages and seating configurations (e.g. sharing for 2 kids seated next to each other). In one particular embodiment of this design, the beverage sharing/tasting straw end attachment can be adapted to fit over any currently available standard straw thereby converting a traditional single person straw to a multi-person sharing/tasting straw.

The apparatus utilizes a sturdy solid tube to create a separation between the area enclosed within the tube and body of liquid outside. A guiding lid with multiple openings allows a specific tool to be guided into the tube for conducting repairs. A draining assembly drains the liquid enclosed within the tube. A drier assembly creates a dry workable space within the tube. A repair assembly is used to conduct a specific repair operation including spray painting, filling up holes, filling in caulking to cover up cracks, sanding within the workable space. An inspection assembly is used to remotely inspect the surface that needs repair.

                            A system, methodology, and product to sort, organize and store individual members of building/construction toy sets utilizing a multi-level system of bins with sieves at different heights using user applied forces and gravity to automatically sort and organize pieces into bins, while providing a fun hands-on sorting experience for kids. The location, size and shape of the sieves can be designed to optimize sorting speed and user experience for specific toy manufacturer brands including Lego™ bricks made by Lego Corporation. The system also functions as a storage unit for the pieces, during and after sort. A flexible binding mechanism holds the system together during sort.
